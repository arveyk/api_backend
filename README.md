<-- API-Backend -->

In this repo I am creating backend API's that will facilitate creating new user in a database, updating a user, retriving users and deleting a user

There are two implementations
<br>
<i>backend</i> directory contains the Flask and FlaskSqlAlchemy implementation
<i>backend_js</i> constain the nodejs, express implementation
